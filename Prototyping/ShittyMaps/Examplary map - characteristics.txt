Used skills:
- double jump
- wall jump
- glide

map elements:
- three flag spawn sites on the map
- red team spawn
- blue team spawn
- solid ground
- platforms (player can jump down, phasing through them)
- bouncing plant

map rules:
- flag spawns randomly between spawn areas
- symmetry, symmetry, SYMMETRY!
- not too big - in the beginning only 2 players will play. Let's say, 
	running from left to right ought take 10 seconds
- player bases positioned at similar height as middle flag spawn site
- at least 3 routes leading to any given neutral base
- try to make the routes same in length. I know, I know, will be tough to do
